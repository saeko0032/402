Q; What kind of design-pattern do you know?
A. I know M-V-C, Model - View - Controller.
When you design the Object-Oriented, Designing pattern is really important.

Model -> POJO (no logic API,sometimes just properties, set/get, create Object just store the some data, manipulate data)
      -> (ex)Food, Drink...
View  -> GraphicalUserInterface, storyboard
Controller -> Connect Model and View together.
           -> (ex)UIViewController
<<Case study>>
Model(UIImage) -> (VC) -> Show the screen Evverytime we need VC to connect from Model to View
